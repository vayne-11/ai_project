Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in Python that structures a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. Let’s dive into the key OOP concepts along with Python's OOP-specific features such as super, decorators, and inheritance.

1. Class and Object
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. The class defines the properties and behaviors (methods) of the objects.

python
Copy code
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}")

# Create an object
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
car1.display()
Here, Car is the class, and car1 is an object of the Car class.

2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (parent class).

Types of Inheritance in Python:

Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from a single parent class.
python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle started")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving")

car = Car()
car.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle
car.drive()  # Defined in Car
Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
python
Copy code
class Engine:
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Wheels:
    def roll(self):
        print("Wheels are rolling")

class Car(Engine, Wheels):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving")

car = Car()
car.start_engine()  # Inherited from Engine
car.roll()          # Inherited from Wheels
car.drive()         # Defined in Car
Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from another child class.
python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle started")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving")

class SportsCar(Car):
    def race(self):
        print("Sports car racing")

car = SportsCar()
car.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle
car.drive()  # Inherited from Car
car.race()   # Defined in SportsCar
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle started")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def ride(self):
        print("Bike is riding")

car = Car()
car.start()
car.drive()

bike = Bike()
bike.start()
bike.ride()
3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means the ability to use a single interface for different data types. A common example is method overriding, where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.

python
Copy code
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("This is an animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Cat meows")

def make_sound(animal):
    animal.sound()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

make_sound(dog)  # Dog barks
make_sound(cat)  # Cat meows
Here, both Dog and Cat override the sound method, and the correct method is called based on the object type.

4. super() Keyword
The super() function in Python is used to call a method from the parent class, often in the context of method overriding.

python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} vehicle is starting")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        super().__init__(brand)  # Call parent class constructor
        self.model = model

    def start(self):
        super().start()  # Call parent class method
        print(f"{self.model} car is ready to drive")

car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
car.start()
In this example, super().__init__(brand) calls the parent class (Vehicle) constructor, and super().start() calls the parent class start method inside the child class.

5. Decorators
Decorators in Python are a way to modify or enhance the behavior of a function or a method without changing its structure. They are widely used in OOP for modifying method behavior.

Function Decorators:

python
Copy code
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
Here, @my_decorator enhances the behavior of say_hello() by adding pre- and post-function behavior.

Class Method Decorators:

@staticmethod: Declares a method that does not access any instance or class variables.
@classmethod: Declares a method that accesses the class (cls), not instance-specific data.
python
Copy code
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @classmethod
    def description(cls):
        return f"This is a {cls.__name__} class"

print(MathOperations.add(3, 5))           # 8
print(MathOperations.description())       # This is a MathOperations class
6. Encapsulation and Private Members
Encapsulation refers to restricting access to certain components of an object. In Python, private members can be created by using a double underscore __ before the variable name.

python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.__age = age  # Private attribute

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age

person = Person("John", 30)
print(person.name)        # John
print(person.get_age())   # 30
# print(person.__age)     # This would raise an AttributeError
Putting it all together: Example with Inheritance, super(), polymorphism, and decorators
python
Copy code
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    def work(self):
        return f"{self.name} is working"

class Manager(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name, salary, team_size):
        super().__init__(name, salary)  # Calls parent class constructor
        self.team_size = team_size

    def work(self):  # Method overriding (polymorphism)
        return f"{self.name} is managing a team of {self.team_size} people"

# Static method decorator
class Utility:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_bonus(salary):
        return salary * 0.10

emp = Employee("Alice", 50000)
mgr = Manager("Bob", 80000, 10)

print(emp.work())   # Alice is working
print(mgr.work())   # Bob is managing a team of 10 people
print(Utility.calculate_bonus(emp.salary))  # 5000.0
Summary of Key Concepts:
Class/Objects: Blueprint and instances.
Inheritance: Code reuse mechanism with types like single, multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical.
Polymorphism: Method overriding to allow different behaviors for different object types.
Encapsulation: Restricting access to certain attributes.
super(): Access methods from parent classes.
Decorators: Modify function or method behavior using @staticmethod, @classmethod, etc.
With these, Python’s OOP model is powerful, flexible, and enhances code reuse and modularity.

In Python, several built-in data structures allow you to store and organize data effectively. Each has specific use cases and methods. Here, I will cover the most commonly used data structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Arrays, and Queues, along with their important methods.

1. List
A list is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. You can store mixed data types (integers, strings, etc.) in a list.

Important List Methods:

append(item): Adds an item to the end of the list.
extend(iterable): Extends the list by appending all the elements from the iterable.
insert(index, item): Inserts an item at a given position.
remove(item): Removes the first occurrence of an item.
pop([index]): Removes and returns the item at the given index. If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last item.
clear(): Removes all items from the list.
index(item): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the item.
count(item): Returns the number of occurrences of the item.
sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.
reverse(): Reverses the elements of the list.
copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
Example:

python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.append(6)          # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_list.insert(2, 'a')     # [1, 2, 'a', 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_list.remove(4)          # [1, 2, 'a', 3, 5, 6]
my_list.pop()              # [1, 2, 'a', 3, 5] - returns 6
my_list.reverse()          # [5, 3, 'a', 2, 1]
my_list.sort()             # Error: Can't sort a list with mixed data types
2. Tuple
A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Like lists, tuples can store mixed data types, but you cannot modify them once created.

Important Tuple Methods:

count(item): Returns the number of times an item appears in the tuple.
index(item): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the item.
Example:

python
Copy code
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple.index(3))    # 2
print(my_tuple.count(2))    # 1

# Tuples are immutable, so you can't change them directly
# my_tuple[0] = 10          # Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
3. Set
A set is an unordered, mutable collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicates, and they are not indexed.

Important Set Methods:

add(item): Adds an item to the set.
remove(item): Removes the item from the set; raises an error if the item is not found.
discard(item): Removes the item from the set if it's present; doesn't raise an error if not found.
pop(): Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.
clear(): Removes all elements from the set.
union(set): Returns a new set containing all elements from both sets.
intersection(set): Returns a new set with elements common to both sets.
difference(set): Returns a set with elements in the first set but not in the second.
symmetric_difference(set): Returns a set with elements in either set, but not in both.
issubset(set): Checks whether all elements of this set are contained in another set.
issuperset(set): Checks whether this set contains all elements of another set.
Example:

python
Copy code
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)              # {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.discard(2)          # {1, 3, 4}
my_set.pop()               # Removes an arbitrary element like 1
other_set = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = my_set.union(other_set)         # {3, 4, 5}
intersection_set = my_set.intersection(other_set)  # {3, 4}
4. Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique, and values can be any data type.

Important Dictionary Methods:

get(key, default): Returns the value associated with the key; returns default if the key is not found.
keys(): Returns a view object that displays a list of all keys in the dictionary.
values(): Returns a view object displaying all values.
items(): Returns a view object displaying all key-value pairs as tuples.
update([other_dict]): Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary.
pop(key): Removes the key and returns its value.
popitem(): Removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair.
clear(): Removes all key-value pairs.
Example:

python
Copy code
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
print(my_dict.get('name'))           # Alice
print(my_dict.keys())                # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'city'])
print(my_dict.values())              # dict_values(['Alice', 25, 'New York'])
my_dict.update({'age': 26})          # {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'city': 'New York'}
my_dict.pop('city')                  # Removes 'city': 'New York'
5. Array
An array is a mutable, ordered collection of elements of the same data type. In Python, arrays can be created using the array module, which provides better performance when working with large collections of homogeneous data compared to lists.

Important Array Methods (from the array module):

append(item): Adds an item to the end of the array.
pop([index]): Removes and returns the item at the given index; if not specified, removes the last item.
remove(item): Removes the first occurrence of the item from the array.
index(item): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the item.
reverse(): Reverses the elements of the array.
extend(iterable): Appends elements from the iterable to the array.
Example:

python
Copy code
import array as arr

my_array = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # 'i' stands for signed integer
my_array.append(6)           # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_array.pop()               # Removes and returns 6
my_array.remove(2)           # [1, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_array.index(4))     # 2
6. Queue
A queue is a collection that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. Python provides the deque class from the collections module for creating queues efficiently.

Important Queue Methods (from collections.deque):

append(item): Adds an item to the right end of the queue.
appendleft(item): Adds an item to the left end of the queue.
pop(): Removes and returns the item from the right end of the queue.
popleft(): Removes and returns the item from the left end of the queue.
clear(): Removes all items from the queue.
Example:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

queue = deque([1, 2, 3])
queue.append(4)              # [1, 2, 3, 4]
queue.appendleft(0)          # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
queue.pop()                  # Removes 4
queue.popleft()              # Removes 0
Summary of Data Structures:
Data Structure	Mutable	Ordered	Unique Elements	Common Methods
List	Yes	Yes	No	append, insert, pop, remove, sort
Tuple	No	Yes	No	count, index
Set	Yes	No	Yes	add, remove, union, intersection
Dictionary	Yes	No	Keys must be unique	get, keys,

Let’s dive into the selected topics one by one, starting with File Handling and covering all the requested topics with examples.

1. File Handling in Python

File handling allows us to read, write, and manipulate files. Python provides built-in functions and methods to work with files. The most common operations are reading, writing, appending, and deleting files.

Basic Syntax:
python
Copy code
# Opening a file
file_object = open("filename.txt", mode)
File Modes:
'r': Read (default) – Opens the file for reading, and raises an error if the file doesn’t exist.
'w': Write – Opens the file for writing, creates the file if it doesn’t exist, and overwrites if it exists.
'a': Append – Opens the file for appending, creates the file if it doesn’t exist.
'r+': Read and Write – Opens the file for both reading and writing.
'b': Binary mode (add 'b' to any mode, e.g., 'rb').
Writing to a File:
python
Copy code
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is Python file handling.")
Reading from a File:
python
Copy code
# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()  # Reads the entire file
    print(content)

# Read line by line
with open("example.txt", 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # Strip removes trailing newline
Appending to a File:
python
Copy code
# Appending to a file
with open("example.txt", 'a') as file:
    file.write("\nAppending another line.")
File Methods:
read(size): Reads size bytes (or the entire file if not specified).
readline(): Reads a single line from the file.
write(string): Writes the string to the file.
writelines(list): Writes a list of strings to the file.
close(): Closes the file (not needed when using with statement).
Context Manager (with Statement):
The with statement is used to handle file closing automatically:

python
Copy code
with open("example.txt", 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
# File is automatically closed after the block
2. Exception Handling in Python

Python provides a way to handle errors using exceptions. The goal is to ensure the program doesn’t crash when encountering an error, but instead, handles it gracefully.

Basic Syntax of try-except:
python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might throw an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handle the specific exception
    print("You cannot divide by zero.")
Catching Multiple Exceptions:
python
Copy code
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
    print("Caught ZeroDivisionError or ValueError")
The finally Block:
The finally block is always executed, whether an exception occurs or not, typically used for cleanup operations.

python
Copy code
try:
    file = open("file.txt")
    # Some file operations
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
finally:
    file.close()  # This will always execute to close the file
The else Block:
The else block is executed if no exceptions are raised.

python
Copy code
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error occurred.")
else:
    print("No errors, result is:", result)
Raising Exceptions:
You can raise your own exceptions using raise.

python
Copy code
def check_age(age):
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("Age must be 18 or older.")
    return True

try:
    check_age(15)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
Creating Custom Exceptions:
python
Copy code
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom error.")
except CustomError as e:
    print(e)
3. Modules and Packages in Python

Modules and packages help in organizing code into reusable components.

Modules:
A module is simply a Python file (.py) that contains Python code (functions, classes, variables).

Importing a Module:

import module_name: Import the whole module.
from module_name import something: Import specific functions, classes, or variables.
Example: Creating and Using a Module
Let's say we have a module my_module.py:

python
Copy code
# my_module.py
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
Now, you can use this module:

python
Copy code
import my_module

print(my_module.greet("Alice"))
Packages:
A package is a collection of modules, organized into directories with an __init__.py file.

Example:

Assume you have a directory structure like this:

markdown
Copy code
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
You can import modules from a package:

python
Copy code
from my_package import module1, module2
Installing Third-Party Modules:
You can use pip to install external modules (libraries):

bash
Copy code
pip install requests  # Installing 'requests' library
4. Pythonic Programming

"Pythonic" refers to writing code that is idiomatic and follows Python’s philosophy of simplicity and readability. Here are some key principles and features of Pythonic programming.

1. List Comprehensions:
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists:

python
Copy code
# Without list comprehension
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# Pythonic way using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
2. Enumerate:
Use enumerate() to iterate over a list and get the index and value at the same time:

python
Copy code
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
for index, name in enumerate(names):
    print(f"{index}: {name}")
3. Unpacking:
Unpacking allows for more readable variable assignment from sequences:

python
Copy code
# Tuple unpacking
person = ("Alice", 25, "Developer")
name, age, job = person
4. Using with for Resource Management:
Instead of manually opening and closing files (or other resources), use the with statement:

python
Copy code
with open("example.txt") as file:
    content = file.read()
# The file is automatically closed after the block
5. Using zip():
zip() allows you to combine two or more lists into tuples:

python
Copy code
names = ["Alice", "Bob"]
ages = [25, 30]

combined = zip(names, ages)  # [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30)]
6. Dunder Methods (Magic Methods):
Special methods (also called dunder methods because they are surrounded by double underscores) allow you to define behavior for your objects:

python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Define a string representation for the object
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}, {self.age} years old"

person = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person)  # Output: Alice, 25 years old
7. EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission):
Instead of checking if a key exists in a dictionary first (like in C-style languages), just try accessing the key and handle the exception if it doesn’t exist:

python
Copy code
# Non-Pythonic way (asking for permission)
if 'key' in my_dict:
    value = my_dict['key']

# Pythonic way (EAFP - ask for forgiveness)
try:
    value = my_dict['key']
except KeyError:
    value = None
8. Use of any() and all():
any() returns True if any element in the iterable is true.
all() returns True if all elements in the iterable are true.
python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 0]
if any(numbers):
    print("At least one number is non-zero")

if all(numbers):
    print("All numbers are non-zero")
else:
    print("At least one number is zero")
9. Context Managers:
Write your own context manager to ensure resources are managed properly:

python
Copy code
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")

with MyContextManager():
    print("Inside the context")

Let's dive into the Functions section of Python! Functions allow us to reuse code and make our programs more organized, efficient, and readable.

1. Defining and Calling Functions

Defining a Function:
You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The function body contains the code the function will execute.

Syntax:

python
Copy code
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    return expression  # Optional return statement
Example:

python
Copy code
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
Calling a Function:
To call a function, you simply use the function name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments inside the parentheses:

python
Copy code
greet("Alice")
2. Function Arguments

2.1. Positional Arguments
These are the most common type of arguments where the values passed into the function are assigned to parameters in the order in which they are defined.

python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are positional arguments
print(result)  # Output: 8
2.2. Keyword Arguments
You can also specify arguments by parameter name, regardless of their position.

python
Copy code
def describe_person(name, age):
    return f"{name} is {age} years old."

print(describe_person(name="Alice", age=30))  # Keyword arguments
2.3. Default Arguments
You can provide default values for parameters. If no argument is provided when calling the function, the default value will be used.

python
Copy code
def greet(name="stranger"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet())  # Output: Hello, stranger!
print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
2.4. Variable-Length Arguments
There are two ways to handle variable-length arguments in Python: *args and **kwargs.

Using *args:

*args allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments into the function. It collects extra arguments into a tuple.

python
Copy code
def add_all(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(add_all(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10
Using **kwargs:

**kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments into the function. It collects extra keyword arguments into a dictionary.

python
Copy code
def describe_person(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

describe_person(name="Alice", age=30, job="Developer")
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 30
# job: Developer
3. Return Values

Functions can return values using the return statement. If no return statement is specified, the function returns None by default.

python
Copy code
def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
Multiple Return Values:
A function can return multiple values by separating them with commas. These values are returned as a tuple.

python
Copy code
def get_person_info():
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    return name, age

person_name, person_age = get_person_info()
print(person_name, person_age)  # Output: Alice 30
4. Scope and the global and nonlocal Keywords

4.1. Scope of Variables
Local Scope: Variables defined inside a function are local to that function.
Global Scope: Variables defined outside of functions are globally accessible.
python
Copy code
x = 10  # Global variable

def example():
    y = 5  # Local variable
    return x + y

print(example())  # Output: 15
4.2. The global Keyword
If you want to modify a global variable inside a function, you need to use the global keyword.

python
Copy code
x = 10

def modify_global():
    global x
    x = 20

modify_global()
print(x)  # Output: 20
4.3. The nonlocal Keyword
The nonlocal keyword allows you to modify a variable from an outer (non-global) scope, such as from an enclosing function in nested functions.

python
Copy code
def outer():
    x = 10

    def inner():
        nonlocal x  # Modify the variable from the outer function
        x = 20

    inner()
    print(x)  # Output: 20

outer()
5. Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)

A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can have any number of input arguments but only one expression. The expression is automatically returned.

Syntax:
python
Copy code
lambda arguments: expression
Example:
python
Copy code
# Regular function
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Equivalent lambda function
add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y

print(add_lambda(3, 5))  # Output: 8
Lambda functions are often used with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().

Example with map():
python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
6. Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that either:

Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
Returns a function as its result.
Example: Function as Argument
python
Copy code
def apply_twice(func, arg):
    return func(func(arg))

def square(x):
    return x * x

result = apply_twice(square, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 81 (square of square of 3)
Example: Returning Functions
python
Copy code
def make_multiplier(n):
    def multiplier(x):
        return x * n
    return multiplier

doubler = make_multiplier(2)
tripler = make_multiplier(3)

print(doubler(5))  # Output: 10
print(tripler(5))  # Output: 15
7. Recursive Functions

A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its definition. Recursion is useful for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-tasks.

Example: Factorial using Recursion
python
Copy code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
Example: Fibonacci using Recursion
python
Copy code
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(6))  # Output: 8
8. Decorators

A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without modifying the original function’s code.

Syntax:
python
Copy code
@decorator_function
def function_to_decorate():
    pass
Example: Simple Decorator
python
Copy code
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something before the function.")
        func()
        print("Something after the function.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Something before the function.
# Hello!
# Something after the function.
Example: Decorator with Arguments
python
Copy code
def repeat(n):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@repeat(3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
# Output:
# Hello, Alice!
# Hello, Alice!
# Hello, Alice!
9. Anonymous Functions vs Regular Functions

Anonymous Functions (Lambda):
Syntax: Single-line, used for small operations.
Can’t contain multiple expressions or statements.
Regular Functions:
Syntax: Can be multi-line.
Used for more complex operations and can return multiple results.
Summary:
Function Definitions: You can define functions using def.
Function Arguments: Includes positional, keyword, default, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).
Return Values: Functions can return one or multiple values.
Scope: Variables have local and global scope, controlled using global and nonlocal.
Lambda Functions: Small, anonymous functions for simple expressions.
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take or return other functions.
Recursive Functions: Functions that call themselves.
Decorators: Functions that modify other functions' behavior.

Dunder (Magic) Methods in Python
Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are a set of predefined methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (__). These methods allow you to define how objects of your custom classes behave in certain operations, such as arithmetic operations, string representations, comparison, iteration, etc. These methods are automatically invoked when their corresponding operation is performed on an object.

Common Dunder Methods
__init__: This method is the constructor of a class. It is called when a new object is created.
python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person = Person("Alice", 30)  # __init__ is called automatically
__str__: Defines the string representation of an object (used by str() and print()).
python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}, {self.age} years old"

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person)  # Output: Alice, 30 years old (calls __str__)
__repr__: Provides an official string representation of the object (used by repr() and in debugging). The goal is to return a string that could recreate the object.
python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person({self.name!r}, {self.age!r})"

print(repr(person))  # Output: Person('Alice', 30) (calls __repr__)
__add__, __sub__, etc.: These methods allow operator overloading for arithmetic operations.
__add__(self, other) – for +
__sub__(self, other) – for -
__mul__(self, other) – for *
Example:

python
Copy code
class Number:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Number(self.value + other.value)

num1 = Number(10)
num2 = Number(20)
result = num1 + num2  # Calls __add__
print(result.value)  # Output: 30
__eq__, __lt__, __gt__, etc.: These methods allow comparison between objects.
__eq__(self, other) – for ==
__lt__(self, other) – for <
__gt__(self, other) – for >
Example:

python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.age == other.age

alice = Person("Alice", 30)
bob = Person("Bob", 30)
print(alice == bob)  # Output: True (calls __eq__)
__len__: Defines the behavior of len() on your objects.
python
Copy code
class Team:
    def __init__(self, members):
        self.members = members
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.members)

team = Team(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])
print(len(team))  # Output: 3 (calls __len__)
__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__: These methods define behavior for indexing, assigning, and deleting elements using square brackets [].
__getitem__(self, key) – for obj[key]
__setitem__(self, key, value) – for obj[key] = value
__delitem__(self, key) – for del obj[key]
Example:

python
Copy code
class CustomList:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.data[index]

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):
        self.data[index] = value

my_list = CustomList([1, 2, 3])
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1 (calls __getitem__)
my_list[1] = 10  # Calls __setitem__
__call__: This method allows an instance of a class to be called as a function.
python
Copy code
class Greeter:
    def __call__(self, name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet = Greeter()
greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice! (calls __call__)
Other Common Dunder Methods
__contains__(self, item): Defines the behavior of in for your object.
__iter__(self): Defines the behavior for iteration, used in loops.
__next__(self): Defines the behavior for fetching the next item in an iterator.
__enter__ and __exit__: Used to define the behavior of objects when used in a with statement (context managers).
Summary of Dunder Methods
Dunder methods allow Python classes to define how they behave with operators and built-in functions.
They make your custom objects more intuitive, allowing the use of operators, iteration, and more, just like built-in types.
Common dunder methods include __init__, __str__, __add__, __eq__, __len__, __getitem__, and __call__.
Now that we’ve covered dunder methods, I’ll generate a PDF containing all the information shared in this session.
